You need to have the folder on the Desktop of your computer and need the Dev C++ compiler with the Allegro Library. I do not own the photos or the rights to the Sam & Max name, this is simply an homage to them. A fan game made for a college assignment
  
Instructions to make this game work:
1. You must have the Dev c++ compiler installed with the Allegro library also installed on it

2. After you extract the folder, remove the folder inside out to the Desktop and change the name to "Game"

3. Of the files labelled Project 1, the (.exe) one is the one you select to run the game

4. When you select it a window will come up saying it can't run, just click "more info" and then "run anyway" and it should work.
